This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and you try to access the value before it has been fully retrieved.  The `getItem` method is asynchronous, meaning it doesn't return the value immediately; instead, it returns a Promise. If you try to use the result directly without handling the Promise, you'll encounter this issue. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as displaying undefined or null values or causing crashes further down the line. For example:

```javascript
const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey'); // Correct - using await
console.log(value); // Use the value here
```

```javascript
// Incorrect - not handling the promise correctly
AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey').then(value => console.log(value));
console.log(AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey')); // This will not work
```
