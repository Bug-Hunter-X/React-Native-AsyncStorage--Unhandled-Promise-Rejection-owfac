This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native when using AsyncStorage. The bug involves accessing AsyncStorage values before the asynchronous operation completes. The solution involves correctly handling the Promise returned by AsyncStorage.getItem using async/await or .then().  This leads to clearer, more robust code that avoids unexpected undefined values or application crashes.  The example code showcases both the incorrect and correct approaches.
